Description: Make informed, data-driven decisions for your personal or
    household finances. Use tools and methods that are selected carefully
    to align with academic consensus, bridging the gap between theoretical
    knowledge and practical application. They assist you in finding
    optimal asset allocation, preparing for retirement or financial
    independence, calculating optimal spending, and more.
