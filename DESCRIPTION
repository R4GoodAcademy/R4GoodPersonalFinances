Description: Make optimal decisions for your personal or
    household finances. Use tools and methods that are selected carefully
    to align with academic consensus, bridging the gap between theoretical
    knowledge and practical application. They help you find
    your own personalized optimal discretionary spending or
    optimal asset allocation, and prepare you for retirement 
    or financial independence.
    The optimal solution to this problems is extremely complex,
    and we only have a single lifetime to get it right.
    Fortunately, we now have the user-friendly tools implemented,
    that integrate life-cycle models 
    with single-period net-worth mean-variance optimization models. 
    Those tools can be used by anyone who wants to see 
    what highly-personalized optimal decisions can look like.
