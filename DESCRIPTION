Description: Make informed, data-driven decisions 
    for your personal or household finances. 
    Use tools and methods that are selected carefully 
    to align with academic consensus, 
    bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. 
    They assist you in finding optimal asset allocation, 
    preparing for retirement or financial independence, 
    calculating optimal spending, and more.
