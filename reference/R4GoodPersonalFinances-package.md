# R4GoodPersonalFinances: Make Optimal Financial Decisions

Make optimal decisions for your personal or household finances. Use
tools and methods that are selected carefully to align with academic
consensus, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical
application. They help you find your own personalized optimal
discretionary spending or optimal asset allocation, and prepare you for
retirement or financial independence. The optimal solution to this
problems is extremely complex, and we only have a single lifetime to get
it right. Fortunately, we now have the user-friendly tools implemented,
that integrate life-cycle models with single-period net-worth
mean-variance optimization models. Those tools can be used by anyone who
wants to see what highly-personalized optimal decisions can look like.
